My intial idea was to do a phone of some type, 
but I also wanted to keep it super simple. Only because I am SUPER new to the web/coding world.
I don't know much about it and I was trying to use my notes from other classes for my CSS and HTML. I did ended up 
getting a little bit of help but I think over all I love the wat it turned out. I really like how the phone looks 
and it just looks user friend. I really enjoy making this project! 

I also liked the class, was confused for a while
but then started to get the hang of it. I loved that for every emotion the user would click, there was an 
inspirational qoute given! So, hopefully it was inspirational :)
